# Description
I am a football analyst hired by the company Mchezopesa Ltd. to:

1. Predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (including rank of the respective team).
2. Testing a Hypothesis: Whether there is difference in the means of blue cars taken in two different postal codes selected randomly.

# Experimental Design
1. Performing EDA
2. Performing necessary feature engineering
3. Checking multicollinearity
4. Building a model:
    - Approach 1: Polynomial regression model
      - Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores
      - Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores
    - Approach 2: Logistic regression model
      - Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
5. Cross-validating the model
6. Computing RMSE
7. Creating residual plots for the model
8. Assessing Heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test
9. Challenging the solution.
